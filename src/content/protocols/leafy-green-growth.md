title: "Leafy green growth cycle: ISS-adapted protocol"
summary: "A structured protocol for cultivating leafy greens in constrained microgravity hardware. It separates a lab-grade flow (with controlled gas composition, calibrated PAR, and frequent sampling) from an at-home analogue suited for classrooms or outreach kits. The focus is on safety boundaries, minimum instrumentation, and the checkpoints that must be documented to compare runs across facilities without overstating statistical power."

year: 2022
level_of_evidence: "L2"
evidence_rationale: "Protocol elements draw from peer-reviewed space crop studies; some steps extrapolated for comparability and need field validation."
lab_variant: "Requires controlled environment chamber, calibrated LED spectra, CO2 control, sterilized wicking media, weekly leaf tissue sampling, and nitrate assays."
at_home_variant: "Uses desktop growth chamber with food-safe wicks, LED grow light, temperature logging, and visual phenotyping with smartphone timelapse."
safety_scope: "No GMO work. Emphasize sterile handling, safe disposal of media, and avoidance of untested nutrient concentrates in non-lab settings."
