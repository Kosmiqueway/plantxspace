title: "Water availability is the dominant risk for sustained plant growth in transit habitats"
statement: "Maintaining stable root-zone hydration under microgravity or partial gravity is harder than matching light or nutrient supply."
status: "supported"
rationale: "Historical ISS grow-outs report hydration and biofilm issues more frequently than light instability. Published hardware reports highlight wicking and gas exchange as recurring bottlenecks. Until alternative architectures are validated, designs should assume water management is the first-order constraint."
