title: "Closed-loop nutrient delivery in partial gravity"
summary: "Nutrient delivery systems for partial gravity missions must balance capillary flow, gas exchange, and clogging risk. This topic maps the design space for wick-based, hydroponic, and aeroponic approaches in lunar and Martian transit scenarios. It catalogs published performance envelopes, identifies open parameters that lack validation data, and prioritizes which subsystems require rig testing before integration into long-duration plant modules."

Canon topic. Emphasizes measurable parameters: flow stability, oxygenation, failure modes, and cleaning/maintenance burden. Future work should attach metrics to specific plant species and growth stages.
