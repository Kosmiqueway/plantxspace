title: "Radiation shielding constraint"
summary: "Radiation shielding affects plant growth systems by limiting the available mass, volume, and transparency for lighting. This entry clarifies how shielding trade-offs shape enclosure design and why claims of radiation hardiness must be tied to spectrum, dose, and exposure duration. It also points to standard measurement units and reporting practices that help compare datasets across habitats."

Canon glossary entry. Prefer reporting in dose equivalent (mSv) and specifying shielding material thickness. Cite measurement tools when available.
