## Mission
The curated zone is the essential library for the OrbitalBioSystems team: it filters noise and surfaces only materials directly relevant to biotechnology in space and dual-use Earth applications. Its purpose is to back research and development decisions with validated, condensed, and actionable information so every selected reference saves time and reduces technical risk.

## Primary audience
- Researchers and engineers developing bioprocessing in microgravity.
- Hardware and automation specialists for bioreactors in isolated environments.
- Product managers and technical leads shaping experiment roadmaps.
- Regulatory/QA partners validating safety and compliance.

## Content selection criteria
- **Methodological rigor:** transparent experimental design (methods, replicates, statistics), declared limitations, and access to data or protocols when available.
- **Freshness:** published or reviewed within the last 18 months, or older only if it remains a foundational reference with no modern replacement.
- **Practical utility:** provides procedures, operating parameters, checklists, or direct linkage to current R&D decisions; avoid purely speculative materials.
- **Scientific validation:** reproducible results, peer review, or independent validation; for internal sources, requires at least one replication and a technical owner.
- **Readability and clarity:** concise structure, key charts/diagrams, accessible language; extract an executive summary of at most five bullets per resource.
- **Source traceability:** clear identifiers (DOI, stable link, version) and usage rights compatible with internal redistribution.

## Revalidation cadence
- **Biweekly review:** each resource is tagged with the last check date and evaluated every two weeks for updates, withdrawals, or better alternatives.
- **Fast signals:** any regulatory change or major publication triggers a mini-review within 72 hours.

## Responsible owner
- **Owner:** Curated zone Content Lead (current: [name], Research Content Lead).
- **Responsibilities:** applies the criteria, approves/rejects submissions, maintains version history, and coordinates revalidations; may delegate assessments but retains veto power.
