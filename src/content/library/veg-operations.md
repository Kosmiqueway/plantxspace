title: "Veggie hardware operations overview"
summary: "The Veggie platform on the International Space Station is one of the longest-running plant growth systems in microgravity. This summary captures its modular architecture, light and nutrient control approach, and the operational lessons that have been published through NASA experiment briefs. It highlights what has been documented to work, what still needs replication, and where the hardware interfaces constrain new plant protocols."

Key details: deployable pillows, LED arrays tuned for leafy greens, and forced-air recirculation with wicks for root zone hydration. Constraints include limited autonomy, reliance on crew time for routine maintenance, and narrow crop range. This entry is canon; updates require citing new flight reports or peer-reviewed studies.
