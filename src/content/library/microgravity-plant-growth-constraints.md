title: "Constraints on plant growth in microgravity environments"
summary: "Spaceflight studies on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station show that microgravity primarily challenges plant growth through altered fluid and gas transport, disrupted gravity-dependent signaling, and operational limits in tightly constrained habitats. The absence of buoyancy-driven convection thickens boundary layers, making CO₂/O₂ exchange and heat removal dependent on forced airflow. Capillary-dominated water movement risks hypoxia and uneven nutrient delivery, while weak mechanical loading alters root architecture. Hardware and crew-time limits further restrict light spectra, CO₂ setpoints, and watering precision."

Microgravity removes sedimentation and buoyancy forces, so gas exchange relies on forced ventilation; inadequate airflow elevates boundary-layer resistance and can cause localized hypoxia despite nominal cabin CO₂. Nutrient solutions and moisture do not settle, making capillary control and wicking media essential to prevent root flooding or drought. Gravitropic signaling pathways lose the vector needed for directional growth, leading to disoriented roots and altered hormone distribution unless phototropic cues dominate. Weak mechanical loading reduces thigmomorphogenic responses, influencing cell wall deposition and stem rigidity. Operational constraints—limited crew time, fixed light spectra and photoperiods, and tightly bounded CO₂ ranges—further narrow species and phenotype performance in flight systems.
