title: "Root-zone aeration tweaks for small form-factor kits"
summary: "A set of community-suggested tweaks for improving oxygen availability in compact plant kits used for outreach. Ideas include perforated lattice inserts, low-cost piezo microbubblers, and rotating wicks to avoid biofilm buildup. None of these approaches have flight data; they are listed to invite testing and to document failure modes early."
