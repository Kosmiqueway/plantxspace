# OrbitalBiosystems

**Tagline:** Evidence-first systems for plants beyond Earth.

**Core research question:** How can we design, operate, and validate resilient plant biosystems for long-duration space missions without sacrificing Earth co-benefits?

OrbitalBiosystems is a public, citable open research hub focused on credible knowledge for space plant biosystems. We prioritize clarity, structure, evidence, and sustainability over volume or hype.
