# Governance

## Principles
- Evidence over opinion; traceability for all decisions.
- Two-lane system: Canon (curated) vs Sandbox (experimental) with explicit labels.
- Stability and readability over velocity.

## Roles
- **Maintainer:** Oversees roadmap, merges PRs, ensures evidence standards.
- **Reviewer:** Provides domain or methodological review; can block merges on quality grounds.
- **Contributor:** Proposes content or code aligned with style and evidence rules.

## Decision-making
- Changes to canon content require at least one domain review and one methodological review.
- Sandbox additions can be merged with a maintainer review but must keep level_of_evidence = L0.
- Breaking changes to structure, schemas, or governance need maintainer approval and a recorded rationale in PR.

## Rejection criteria
- Missing required metadata or evidence rationale.
- Claims of affiliation, endorsement, or authority not backed by sources.
- Marketing language or speculative statements without bounds.
- Content that cannot be traced to a source URL or identifiable origin.

## Review cadence
- Issues triaged weekly; PR review target: within 5 business days.
- Canon entries revalidated at least biweekly; assumptions reviewed monthly.

## Escalation
- Disputes on evidence level or status escalate to maintainers; add rationale to PR history.
