# Roadmap (sustainable cadence)

## Phase 1: Foundation (0–3 months)
- Stabilize schemas and evidence levels (L0–L3) across collections.
- Publish initial canon entries in library/topics/protocols/models/glossary with traceability.
- Stand up CI: build + link checks.
- Add assumptions registry and citation guidance.

## Phase 2: Depth and validation (3–9 months)
- Expand canon with validated protocols and modeled envelopes tied to real data.
- Add replication notes for at least two protocols; capture deviations and outcomes.
- Introduce periodic broken-link audits and content revalidation logs.

## Phase 3: Longevity (9–24 months)
- Tag stable releases for archiving (Zenodo/OSF) without gating access.
- Publish transparency reports on review cadence, acceptance/rejection stats.
- Add lightweight analytics focused on content utility (no tracking of individuals).

## Cadence
- Biweekly content review for canon entries.
- Quarterly roadmap check-in; adjust based on evidence gaps and user feedback.
