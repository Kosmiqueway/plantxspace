# Monetization (design only)

OrbitalBiosystems keeps core knowledge open. Monetization must be ethical, transparent, and avoid paywalls.

## Paths
- Sponsored research or grants tied to open deliverables and published protocols.
- Paid deep-dive reports that synthesize canon findings; release executive summaries openly.
- Consulting, workshops, or partnerships focused on evidence-based design; publish non-sensitive learnings.

## Guardrails
- No gated access to canon content.
- Disclose sponsors and potential conflicts of interest.
- Keep repository public and citation-friendly.
