# Style Guide

## Tone and clarity
- Plain, precise language; avoid hype.
- Lead with evidence and constraints; state limitations.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet lists.

## Structure
- Start with the purpose, then key findings or steps, then limitations.
- Always include level_of_evidence (L0–L3) and evidence_rationale.
- Summaries: 40–120 words; avoid filler.

## Citations and links
- Provide a stable source URL. Use DOIs where possible.
- Attribute authors/organisations; do not invent affiliations.
- For derived models or protocols, note assumptions and calibration bounds.

## Accessibility and readability
- One H1 per page.
- Provide alt text for images.
- Use descriptive link text; avoid “click here.”

## Canon vs Sandbox labeling
- Canon: evidence-tagged, curated. Sandbox: clearly non-peer-reviewed with level_of_evidence = L0.
